get_allele_frequency_37(rsid,effect_allele,other_allele)
get_allele_frequency_38(rsid,effect_allele,other_allele)

ps:37&38 represents different grch versions
and this function only works for a single SNP
create this function as sometimes can not use afl2_rsid
use this after filter and ld clump would help you save a lot time
